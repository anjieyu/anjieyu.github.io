I wrote this article for the Lakeridge Newspacer in 2023. This article is about the robotics team's app for users to explore Lake Oswego's history.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/images/news-1.png" title="Lake Oswego Article" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" style="text-align: center" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>


Writing this article made me think of how we can use technology to spread information and provide learning resources.
