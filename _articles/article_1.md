I wrote this article for the Lakeridge Newspacer in 2023. This article is about the robotics team's app for users to explore Lake Oswego's history.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include article_figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/images/news-1.png" title="Lake Oswego Article" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; flex-direction: row; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center;" %}
    </div>
</div>



Writing this article made me think of how we can use technology to spread information and provide learning resources.
